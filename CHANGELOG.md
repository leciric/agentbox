# Changelog

All notable, user-facing changes to AgentBox are documented here, in the style of
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Nothing older than 0.3.0 is listed.

## Unreleased

### Added

- **Auto-stop idle agents**: an optional switch in Settings → Every agent, off by default, that
  stops a running or paused agent once it has gone an idle time (2h by default) with nothing
  happening on it — no chat turn, no job, no waiting question or credential request, no terminal
  input and no recording. Stopping keeps its worktree and branch, like stopping it by hand, and the
  agent view shows why: "Stopped after 2h idle".
- A `CHANGELOG.md`, and a "What's new" view (Settings → This app, also shown once after an
  update) that renders it from the running version down.

### Changed

### Fixed

## 0.4.0

### Added

- **Never freeze my CPU**: a switch in Settings → Every agent that keeps a chosen number of cores
  (1 by default) free for the desktop, recomputing every running agent's CPU limit as agents are
  made, started, stopped or destroyed. ([#62](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/62))
- New agents get a memory limit — 8 GiB, or half the host's memory if that's less — and an agent
  with a limit can no longer push its pages into the host's swap.
  ([#55](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/55))
- **Initializing**: a new agent shows a distinct "Initializing" state while it's being made,
  instead of "Needs attention", which is now left for a create that failed or was interrupted.
  ([#60](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/60))

### Fixed

- Opus and Sonnet offer the 1M context window again, instead of being stuck at 200k after a
  session compacted with no compact window set.
  ([#61](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/61))
- The `.pacman` package installs on current Arch again: it no longer depends on `http-parser`,
  which Arch dropped. ([#59](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/59))

## 0.3.0

### Added

- Agent tools (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, the GitHub CLI, the ACP adapters and the rest) update
  in place in the existing base image instead of requiring a rebuild.
  ([#44](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/44))
- A right-click context menu on agent rows: open its chat or terminal, start, stop, pause, resume,
  retire, copy its branch name, open its pull request, or destroy it.
  ([#35](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/35))
- Clicking **Storage pool** in the top bar shows a breakdown of what AgentBox uses on disk.
  ([#36](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/36))
- Anonymous feature-usage stats, sent once a day with the update check; off wherever the update
  check is off. ([#51](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/51))
- A project's pull requests list shows who opened each one.
  ([#45](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/45))
- A [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/blob/main/SECURITY.md) for reporting
  vulnerabilities privately. ([#28](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/28))
- New agents default to 2 CPU cores instead of every core but two.
  ([#41](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/41))

### Changed

- The top bar's usage meter follows the Claude account of the page you're on.
  ([#42](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/42))
- Settings and a project's Overview share one layout, with Settings' tabs grouped as Lead, New
  agents, Every agent and This app. ([#52](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/52))
- The right rail no longer shows agent messages or unread counts; a waiting agent shows "Asks you
  something". ([#43](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/43))
- The agents' desktop has a modern dock, and recordings made with `agentbox media record start
  --input desktop` show click ripples and key captions.
  ([#47](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/47))
- The release workflow builds Linux, Windows and Mac in parallel.
  ([#40](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/40))

### Fixed

- A new project's chat can have its model, effort, context window and mode chosen before its
  first message. ([#49](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/49))
- Opus offers a 1M context window again, instead of being stuck at 200k after a chat compacted
  once. ([#39](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/39))
- The desktop app builds on a Mac-hosted agent's worktree.
  ([#27](https://github.com/leciric/agentbox/pull/27))
